Lyrics:
When I was a young boy, my father
Took me into the city to see a marching band
He said, "Son, when you grow up would you be
The savior of the broken, the beaten and the damned?"
He said, "Will you defeat them? Your demons
And all the non-believers, the plans that they have made?
Because one day, I'll leave you a phantom
To lead you in the summer to join the black parade..."
When I was a young boy, my father
Took me into the city to see a marching band
He said, "Son, when you grow up would you be
The savior of the broken, the beaten and the damned?"

Sometimes I get the feeling she's watching over me
And other times I feel like I should go
And through it all, the rise and fall, the bodies in the streets
And when you're gone, we want you all to know

We'll carry on, we'll carry on, and though you're
Dead and gone, believe me, your memory will carry on
We'll carry on,and in my heart I can't contain it
The anthem won't explain it

A world that sends you reeling from decimated dreams
Your misery and hate will kill us all
So paint it black and take it back, let's shout it loud and clear
Defiant to the end we hear the call

To carry on, we'll carry on, and though you're
Dead and gone, believe me, your memory will carry on
We'll carry on,and though you're broken and defeated
Your weary widow marches

On and on, we carry through the fears (Oh, oh, oh)
Disappointed faces of your peers(Oh, oh, oh)
Take a look at me, 'cause I could not care at all

Do or die, you'll never make me
Because the world will never take my heart
Go and try, you'll never break me
We want it all, we wanna play this part
I won't explain or say I'm sorry
I'm unashamed, I'm gonna show my scars
Give a cheer for all the broken
Listen here, because it's who we are
I'm just a man, I'm not a hero
Just a boy, who had to sing this song
I'm just a man, I'm not a hero
I don't care!

We'll carry on, we'll carry on, and though you're
Dead and gone, believe me, your memory will carry on
We'll carry on,and though you're broken and defeated
Your weary widow marches

Do or die, you'll never make me
Because the world will never take my heart
Go and try, you'll never break me
We want it all, we wanna play this part(We'll carry on!)
Do or die, you'll never make me(We'll carry on!)
Because the world will never take my heart(We'll carry on!)
Go and try, you'll never break me(We'll carry-)
We want it all, we wanna play this part(We'll carry on...)

Lyrics:
Long ago, just like the hearse you die to get in again
We are so far from you
Burning on, just like the match you strike to incinerate
The lives of everyone you know

And what's the worst you take (Worst you take)
From every heart you break? (Heart you break)
And like the blade you stain (Blade you stain)
Well, I've been holding on tonight

What's the worst that I can say?
Things are better if I stay
So long and goodnight
So long, not goodnight

Came a time when every star fall brought you to tears again
We are the very hurt you sold

And what's the worst you take (Worst you take)
From every heart you break? (Heart you break)
And like the blade you stain (Blade you stain)
Well, I've been holding on tonight

What's the worst that I can say?
Things are better if I stay
So long and goodnight
So long and goodnight
Well, if you carry on this way
Things are better if I stay
So long and goodnight
So long and goodnight

(Can you hear me?)
(Are you near me?)
(Can we pretend to leave, and then)
(We'll meet again)
When both our cars collide?

What's the worst that I can say?
Things are better if I stay
So long and goodnight
So long and goodnight
Well, if you carry on this way
Things are better if I stay
So long and goodnight
So long and goodnight

Lyrics:
I never said I'd lie in wait forever
If I died, we'd be together, ow
I can't always just forget her
But she could try

At the end of the world or the last thing I see
You are never coming home, never coming home
Could I? Should I?
And all the things that you never ever told me
And all the smiles that are ever, ever

Ever get the feeling that you're never all alone?
And I remember now
At the top of my lungs in my arms, she dies, she dies

At the end of the world or the last thing I see
You are never coming home, never coming home
Could I? Should I?
And all the things that you never ever told me
And all the smiles that are ever gonna haunt me

Never coming home, never coming home
Could I? Should I?
And all the wounds that are ever gonna scar me
For all the ghosts that are never gonna catch me

If I fall
If I fall down
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

At the end of the world or the last thing I see
You are never coming home, never coming home
Never coming home, never coming home
And all the things that you never ever told me
And all the smiles that are ever going to haunt me

Never coming home, never coming home
Could I? Should I?
And all the wounds that are ever gonna scar me
For all the ghosts that are never gonna...
